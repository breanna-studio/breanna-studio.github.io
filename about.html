					Breanna Robinson (she/her) is a multidisciplinary artist who lives and works in Chicago. Weaving together fragments of dreams, memories, and emotional states, her work renders the multi-layered experience of recollection and explores its vast emotional and material ramifications. Projects tend to take shape through a mix of hand + digital renderings, collage, and image manipulation across a variety of media.
					<br><br>
					Breanna holds a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2017), where she studied print media. Most recently, she has exhibited work with Chicago-based galleries Tiger Strikes Asteroid, Kavi Gupta, and Blanc Gallery, and has participated in residency programs at Lillstreet Art Center and Chicago Artist Coalition. Her work has been highlighted in the press with Hyperallergic and Vocalo.
