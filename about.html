					Breanna (she/her) is a multidisciplinary artist who lives and works in Chicago. She holds a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2017), where she studied printmedia. Most recently, she has exhibited work at the Print Center in New York City, NY, the SGCI 2022 Conference in Madison, WI, and Drama Club gallery in Chicago.
					<br><br>
					Working with a variety of processes including printmaking, collage, drawing, and coding, her projects tend to take shape through a mix of hand + digital renderings, collage, and image manipulation. Prevalent themes in her work include nostalgia (and time, broadly), femininity, media and technology, often in the context of Black American culture, history, and traditions.
