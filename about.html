					Breanna (she/her) is a multidisciplinary artist who lives and works in Chicago. She holds a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2017), where she studied printmedia. Most recently, she has exhibited work at Drama Club, Tiger Strikes Asteroid, and Blanc Gallery in Chicago.
					<br><br>
					Weaving together fragments of dreams, memories, and emotional states, her work renders the multi-layered experience of recollection and explores it's vast emotional and material ramifications. Projects tend to take shape through a mix of hand + digital renderings, collage, and image manipulation across a variety of media.

					<!-- Prevalent themes in her work include nostalgia (and time, broadly), femininity, media and technology, often in the context of Black American culture, history, and traditions. -->
